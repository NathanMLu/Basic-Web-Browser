<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view in the online orientation material for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and  make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know so 
that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.

<h2>Java Version Requirement</h2>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>

      <td><p>Proj03 Copyright 2014 R.G.Baldwin</p>
		<p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write a program named <strong>Proj03</strong> that uses the driver 
		class definition provided in the file named<strong> Proj03.java.</strong> 
		Your program displays a browser that can be used to connect to, 
		download, render, and navigate simple web pages similar to those shown in  <strong>Image01</strong>, 
		 <strong>Image02</strong>, and  <strong>Image03</strong>. <em>(By simple, I mean web pages that do not 
		contain frames, automatic forwarding, and other fancy HTML features.)</em></p>
	  <p>Your program must provide a <strong>Back</strong> button and a <strong>Forward</strong> button as shown 
	  in <strong>Image01</strong>. You can navigate through simple web pages by clicking 
	  hyperlinks with the mouse. You can backtrack your navigation path using 
	  the <strong>Back</strong> button and then move forward through your navigation path using 
	  the <strong>Forward</strong> button.</p>
	  <p>You can navigate to a particular web page by entering the URL in the 
	  text field shown at the top of  <strong>Image01</strong>. <em>(Make your 
	  text field about 35 characters long to make room for long URLs.)</em> The 
	  URL of the page being displayed by your browser must show in the text 
	  field at all times. Note however that this is not reflected in the images 
	  shown below due to the short length of the text field.</p>
	  <p>The code in the driver file named Proj03.java must make your browser 
	  open on the following page. </p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/tocdsp.htm">
	  http://www.dickbaldwin.com/tocdsp.htm</a> </p>
	  <p>Once there, you must be able to navigate to and within any of the following 
	  simple web pages:</p>
			  <p><a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/dsp/Dsp00100.htm">100</a>  
			  Periodic Motion and Sinusoids<br/>
			  <a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/dsp/Dsp00104.htm">104</a>  
			  Sampled Time Series<br/>
			  <a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/dsp/Dsp00108.htm">108</a>  
			  Averaging Time Series </p>
	  <p><em>(You may be able to navigate to other web pages as well, but many 
	  of the links on that page point to pages that contain HTML features that your program 
	  is not required to support.)</em></p>
	  <p>Your program output must provide scroll bars when needed as shown in 
	   <strong>Image01</strong>.</p>
	  <p>You must be able to use hyperlinks, the mouse, the mouse wheel, the 
	  scroll bars, the
	  <strong>Back</strong> button, the <strong>Forward</strong> button, and 
	  the text field to 
	  expose the material shown in <strong>Image01</strong>, <strong>Image02</strong>, 
	  and <strong>Image03</strong>.</p>
	  <p>You must also display the following text on the command-line screen.</p>
	  <pre>I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Print your name here.</pre>

	  <p>Submit only the source code file named <strong>Proj03Runner.java</strong>.</p>
	  <p>I will execute the following steps to confirm that your browser behaves 
	  as required. A failure at any step will disqualify your solution.</p>
